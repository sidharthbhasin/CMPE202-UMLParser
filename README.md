<b>Prohect Guidelines:</b><br>
Submission:

Submission of PDF and ZIP File to include:

URL to a Google Folder, Dropbox Folder (or similar service) to where your a ZIP file of your source code is available.
Readme describing the libraries and tools you used to build your parser.
URL Link to run your App from Web Browser or Access to an AWS EC2 Instance with instructions on how to run your project.  If it is not clear to Graders on how to test your program, you will not receive points.
ZIP file with your Source Code
Grading:

10 points of your project will be graded based live  test case(s) during project demos
10 points for a short one page PDF file describing the libraries and tools you used to create the parser.

If you don't submit your source code, or if your source code is found to be similar to another student's work, your final project submission with be worth zero out of 60.

The parser should also consider different test cases, how to optimize the algorithm and achieve an optimal algorithm.

NOTE:
Static and Abstract notation in UML are rarely used in practice. The project scope won't consider these requirements.

Relationships Between Interfaces is possible conceptually in UML. But, the project scope won't consider these situations.

We will only consider Public Methods
